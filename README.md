Statement: 
Your university’s board game club just hosted a Checkers tournament, and you were assigned
to take notes on the games. Unfortunately, while walking home, you dropped all of your papers
into a puddle! Disaster! Much of what you wrote is now unreadable; all you have left are some
lists of moves played in the middle of various games. Is there some way you can reconstruct
what happened in those games? You had better fix things fast, or they will demote you to
Tic-Tac-Toe recordkeeper!
Checkers (or English Draughts) is a well-known board game with simple rules. It is played on
the dark squares of an 8 × 8 checkerboard. There are two players, Black and White, who
alternate turns moving their pieces (all of Black’s pieces are black and all of White’s pieces are
white). Each piece occupies a single dark square, and can be either a normal man or a
promoted king. A turn consists of choosing one piece and moving it in one of two ways:
1. Shifting it diagonally to an unoccupied adjacent dark square This is called a simple move.
2. If the piece is a man, it can move only in the two
diagonal directions towards the opposing side of the board (towards the bottom for
Black, the top for White). If the piece is a king, it can move in all four diagonal directions.
3. Jumping over an adjacent enemy piece to an unoccupied square immediately on the
other side, then removing (capturing) that piece. Men can jump only in the two directions
described above, while kings can jump in all four. The player can then repeat this step,
continuing to jump with the same piece as long as there are properly-positioned enemy
pieces to capture. Such a sequence of one or more jumps is called a jump move. Figure
